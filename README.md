This is an app made for CS 98 hack-a-thing 2.

**Short description of what I attempted to build**
It is a language learning app that I called Journal Grammar Coach. 
It allows you to take a picture or upload text and then it makes in-line corrections to your writing in another language with a helpful standardized UI. 

**Who did what (if you worked with someone else)**
I worked on my own to do this.

**What I learned**

I used two short YouTube videos to get started learning react native. I also had ChatGPT help me write the initial "hello world" files that set up the general front end and back end structure, then on top of that I learned how to add buttons and functionality on a react native app.

I learned how to setup and build a react native app, connect it to an api, connect Open AI API, and run a dev test on my computer using Apples X Code iPhone emulator. 
I also experimented with the app Expo Go which with simply a qr code lets you test out an app that you are running on your computer.

**How does this hack-a-thing inspire me or relate to my possible project ideas?**

This hack-a-thing inspired me because it is directly related to what we want to build for our project. 
I was able in the ten hours to learn how to set up react native app structure and build a simple language learning app that I will actually use. 
The things I learned in this hack-a-thing will directly contribute to how I work on the react native app for the full-scale project. I significantly flattened my learnign curve.

**What didn't work**

Everything went pretty smoothly. I had one problem when I was trying to use the Expo Go app to demo the app. 
The problem I think was that I needed to be on the same wifi as my comuter to make it work so that the local host for the api would be the same. 
Once I figured that out, demoing the app went smoothly.
